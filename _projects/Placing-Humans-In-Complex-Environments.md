title: "Placing Virtual Humans into Complex Indoor Environments"
excerpt: "Humans interact with their environment through contact. We leverage this insight to
better place moving humans into complex, cluttered indoor scenes such that any actions in the
humans motion is matched by the objects in the scene. For example, a sitting action will sit
on a chair."
