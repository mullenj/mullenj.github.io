I am currently a NSF Fellow and PhD Candidate working in the [GAMMA Lab](http://gamma.umd.edu/) at the
University of Maryland advised by [Dr. Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha)
and [Dr. Ming Lin](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/). I have a strong background in AI-driven robotics and a passion for problems with real-world robotic applications. My research interests lie at the intersection of
Human-Robot Interaction, Embodied AI, and Virtual/Augmented Reality. During my Ph.D. at UMD, I have focused on leveraging large datasets, large simulation platforms, and large language models (LLMs) to enhance robotic perception, decision-making, and communication with users.

I have competed two internships with Amazon, with Alexa AI and Lab 126 respectively, working on projects for the Astro robot. These projects both involved architecting large datasets of emergency situations in home environments, and employed multi-modal LLMs for real-time scene understanding enabling the Astro to both prevent and respond to emergencies (like a fall or a fire) in the home.

Beyond my technical expertise, I am deeply motivated by the real-world impact of AI in robotics and other agents. At Amazon and in academia, I specifically sought out projects and solutions that push the boundaries of what robots can achieve *today*, not just in the distant future. This pragmatic approach has driven my contributions to robotic navigation, anomaly detection, and interaction modeling.

Prior to my Ph.D., I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech. During my time at Virginia Tech I was a member
of the [Collaborative Robotics Lab](https://collab.me.vt.edu) where I was advised by
[Dr. Dylan Losey](https://dylanlosey.com). I also participated in the [Virginia Tech AutoDrive team](https://www.vtautodrive.org) working towards making a Chevy Bolt autonomous.

Outside of research, my main interests are in motorsport, travel, and spending time with friends and family. I took the above picture on a recent trip to Argentine Patagonia!
