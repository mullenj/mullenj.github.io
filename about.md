I am a Second Year Ph.D. student working in the [GAMMA Lab](http://gamma.umd.edu/) at the
University of Maryland advised by [Dr. Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha)
and [Dr. Ming Lin](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/). My research interests lie at the intersection of
Human-Robot Interaction, Embodied AI, and Virtual/Augmented Reality. I am developing methods to enable intuitive
and trust-building communication between robots and users in complex environments. In the future, I aim to work in industry towards creating robots and corresponding user interfaces capable of working more effectively *with* humans.


I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech. During my time at Virginia Tech I was a member
of the [Collaborative Robotics Lab](https://collab.me.vt.edu) where I was advised by
[Dr. Dylan Losey](https://dylanlosey.com). I also participated in the [Virginia Tech AutoDrive team](https://www.vtautodrive.org) working towards making a Chevy Bolt autonomous.

Outside of research, my main interests are in motorsport, travel, and spending time with friends and family. I took the above picture on a recent trip to Argentine Patagonia!
