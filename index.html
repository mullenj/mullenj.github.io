  I am a Second Year Ph.D. student working in the <a href="http://gamma.umd.edu/">GAMMA Lab</a> at the
  University of Maryland advised by <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha">Dr. Dinesh Manocha</a>
  and <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/">Dr. Ming Lin</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of
  Human-Robot Interaction, Embodied AI, and Virtual/Augmented Reality. I am developing methods to enable intuitive
  and trust-building communication between robots and users in complex environments.<br /><br />

    excerpt: "Humans interact with their environment through contact. We leverage this insight to
    better place moving humans into complex, cluttered indoor scenes such that any actions in the
    humans motion is matched by the objects in the scene. For example, a sitting action will sit
    on a chair."

    title: "Multimodal Interfaces for Communicating Robot Learning"
    excerpt: "Robots learn as they interact with humans, but how do humans know what the robot has
    learned and when it needs teaching? We leverage information-rich augmented reality to passively
    visualize what the robot has inferred, and attention-grabbing haptic wristbands to actively prompt
     and direct the humanâ€™s teaching."
